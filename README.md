# Pewlett-Hackcard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The company is on the verge of having a large group of employees retire. The manager has asked that we determine the number of retiring employees there will be per title and to identify the current employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This analysis is meant to help the manager make hiring decisions for the future.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
1. The largest group of employees to retire will be engineers. 
2. The second largest group of employees to retire will be Senior Staff members. This means there will be several employees that can be promoted for these roles.

3.  There are only 1,940 current employees that are available for the mentorship program.
4.  The mentorship prgoram needs to define how many people will reside under each mentor in order to determine if there are enough people to fulfill the needs. 

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

 The organization needs to determine how many roles must be filled in order to maintain the goals of the organization. In addition, the mentorship model must be determined, specifically the number of mentors that are needed for those being hired. Once the organization determines this number, the hiring manager needs to hire at the correlative pace between mentor and new employee. 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
In order to answer this question, the manager needs to decide how many people each mentor will support. The largest group that will be hired is the engineers, but there are only 623 mentor ready employees for the engineers. With a strongly designed mentorship program, it is possible, but it will be very challenging as the number of employees retiring is significatnly higher than the number ready to mentor. While hiring employees into senior leadership positions, they need to add mentoring new employees in the newer roles to the job description. Though these new employees won't know a lot about the company, they will have the skill set needed to train individuals that are newer to their profession.
